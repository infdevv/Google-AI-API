# Google AI API API?

This repository can be hosted on services such as Render so you can for some reason use your Google AI key publicly? I couldn't find a alternative ok?

## How to use:
Set the enviroment variable `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to your api key (obviously).

Now you can just send a POST request to whatever-your-hosting-site-is.com/generate-text and just put the prompt in the body.

Lol, there are thousands of better ways to do this.
